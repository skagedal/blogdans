Recently, I've been trying to involve myself more in the effective altruism movement. 
I've been following this movement for many years. I think I first heard of it on Sam 
Harris podcast interviewing Will McCaskill. I think it was I think related to a book 
Peter Singer's "the most good you can do".

Since then, I've been donating monthly and sometimes bigger amounts. The focus in those 
early days was a lot about this earning to give idea while in recent years, it has moved 
more towards what you can do with your career and things like long-termism.
