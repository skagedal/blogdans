title:  "Take my hand with vocals"
---

Here's the next iteration of the track I called "Take my hand". It now has some vocals. Sounds kind of like a lo-fi Beach Boys lullaby.

While [yesterday's recordings](/posts/2020-06-28-two-small-song-embryos) where done with the Voice Memo app on my iPhone, today I have moved to Garage Band and the built-in microphone on the MacBook Pro. There are some sync problems,  I have to move each track back a half bar after recording. May be possible to fix by lowering some buffer size, but I guess you need real equipment to sort this out. Some day, maybe. 

The lyics need work. Here's what I am singing:

> Take my hand<br />
> Help me understand<br />
> Stroke my head<br />
> Help me understand

(I don't like the second "help me understand".)

I was thinking it would continue with some like:

> Why there is fire<br />
> Why there is rain<br />
> How we were put here<br />
> Why I feel pain

Yes, I do feel very silly putting these very unfinished thoughts out here. But it is the way it has to be right now, I am sorry.
