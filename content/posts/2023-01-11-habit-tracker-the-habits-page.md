Allright! Here's part eleven! Of the habit tracker series! Which started [here](/posts/2023-01-01-writing-a-habit-tracker), for those of you just joining! 

We've set up a little Spring Web MVC service, serving web through Thymeleaf templates, and now I thought we'd start building the real pages a little bit.

First, we'll need a page to manage my daily habits. You should see your list of habits, and be able to add new ones. 

Here's a bit of simple HTML5 for that:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Habits</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Your habits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some habit</li>
    </ul>
    <label>Add new habit: <input></label>
    <button>Add</button>
</body>
</html>
```

Obviously, it validates with the [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). We put it in `habits.html` in the `resources/templates` folder. Then we can add a little view controller to route the `/habits` URL to this page and add a link from our home page, [like this](https://github.com/skagedal/hahabit/commit/79aad4b216df6e9cf91ae9512201e67535aaf83e).   

But now, we want this to not just list a static list of habits. It should reflect our model. This is where we start to add some Thymeleaf specific tags:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Habits</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Your habits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li th:each="habit: ${habits}" th:text="${habit.description}">Some habit</li>
    </ul>
    <label>Add new habit: <input></label>
    <button>Add</button>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, we quickly left valid-HTML5 land. Those `th:` tags are totally not valid HTML5, and adding that fake XML namespace doesn't help. However, browsers don't care and we can still preview our page in a browser, or inline in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA. Which is neat. That namespace-ish also helps the IDE to become aware that this is in fact a Thymeleaf-powered HTML page, and be more helpful with things like formatting and various IDE smartness.

I _like_ the idea of validating HTML, and Thymeleaf does provide us with an alternative syntax, by using tags that look like `data-th-each` instead. Those are allowed by HTML5. But in this mode, we get less help from the IDE. I'll let pragmatism win today. Here's a screenshot of the IDE being helpful:

</figure>


But anyway. The page still looks the same when we run the app. We haven't yet hooked up our actual model with the template. 

But I will let that wait for tomorrow. This is too much to take in for one day. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and was created by Tim Bernersâ€“Lee in 1989, and then all kinds of crazy things happened. Ok, bye.
