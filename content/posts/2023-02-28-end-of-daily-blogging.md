title: "End of daily blogging"
summary: "Two months of daily blogging stops now! Cheers!"
---
For two full months now, I have been writing a post every day on this blog. It's been good, and I'm pretty proud of myself. 

But â€“ time has come to stop. While I felt that I was able to keep things interesting, at least for me, for quite some time, I now feel that energy is too low, and therefore quality has started to suffer. And also I really don't have time. [Yesterday's](/posts/2023-02-27-generating-client) annoying CORS experience[^1] was the last drop.   

I'm hoping that this will have been a boost, and I intend to keep doing just a little bit of writing every day, just not publishing on the blog. Maybe I'll post something on the microblog (follow me at `@skagedal@mastodon.social`) every day. 

Later, folks!

### Notes

[^1]: Which I think was actually just Swagger UI being stupid. Maybe I'll follow up on that :-)
